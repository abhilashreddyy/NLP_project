### Text Analysing Application using
### Natural Language Processing(NLP)

---
## What is this application about ?
+++
* Organizations typically conduct a lot of surverys . To minimize the amount of works Surveys are of the form that get the users to chosse a number as an answer so that it can be easily processed. But a lot of qualitative / behavioural surveys also need to be conducted in an organization and expect the users to type in answers .
  * Questions and Answers are collated as excel files since they are easier to process
  * Each sheet typically consists of questions (as columns ) and answers by multiple people (as rows )
  * Multiple surveys are stored as  sheets
+++
* Time consuming to read all the text and come to a conclusion
* This application attempts to provide a better intution /summary of the answers at a glance.
* Uses azure and google NLP cloud services

## What this application does ?
+++
### 1. Detects Sentiment of an answer . Appends a column to the Excel sheet with sentiment

### 2. Detects the keywords  of an answers and adds a column to the Excel sheet with the keyword
+++
### 3. Generates a Word Cloud of Keywords for each question ( based on the keyword and Topic )

### Topic Detection
* Send request to azure services
* Responds with an URL representing the location where computation of topic detection is performed
* Send get request to URL
* Responds with detected Topics

* Request cloud services for sentiment of each response for a survey and append sentiment to respective response in excel filename
* Topics detected from given text corpus are used to generate word cloud
* Keywords extracted are used for generating word cloud and extracting most relevant answers
---
### Objectives achieved with azure services
* Uses azure *sentiment analysis*(piechart)
* Uses azure key word detection for *extracting keywords*(word cloud)
* Uses azure *topic detection* for generating topic of each sentence (word cloud)
  * keys generated avoids noise in image
* also uses WUP similarity for generating Word-Cloud related to keywords in questionâ€‹

+++
### But !!!
* topic detection *takes 7 to 8 minutes* for returning result
* Some part of request does not support asynchronous requests
* Extracting keywords related to question take 6 to 7 seconds of compilation

+++

### Objectives achieved with google services
* Uses google *sentiment analysis*
* Uses google *syntax analysis*
  * Returns every word saperately tagged with
    * parts of speech (tag,mood,tense etc.)
    * dependency edge of syntax tree
    * lemma of each word
    * Selected parts of speech(noun,verb) are used for extracting keywords  
* Google NLP service also have *entity analysis* which extracts *common nouns* from text

### comparison of google and azure services

google | azure
-------|-------
Returns a dictionary object | returns a json formated string
takes 2.5-2.6 seconds for performing sentiment and keyword analysis | takes 2.2-2.3 seconds for performing sentiment and keyword analysis
Do not have this features | takes 7-8 + no-of-questions minutes for topic detection
+++
google | azure
-------|-------
best for combined analysis of entire file content | best for seperate analysis (eg :if format is like one question many answers)
entity recognition | do not contain this feature




---

### Asynchronous nature of code
* (best ans most intresting part of application)
* First I sent http request to REST services **one by one**
  * as a result it **took 30 seconds** for each time compile and run
* Used libraries **asyncio,aiohttp** and some features of python3 *yield from*
* When i made it **asynchronous** it took **less than 3 seconds** for compile and run

# Design of Application
+++
###Pseudo Code
* Reading from excel file .
  * Initally checking dimensions of file .
  * read entire file column wise .
* Send async request to cloud services .
* Generate Word cloud .
  * Uisng keywords
* Generate piechart .
  * count positive negative and neutral sentences
  * project them on piechart
* Write sentimet and keyword info to excel file .
*
---
###Reading from file
* decides no of columns by considering no of headings
* decides no of rows by considering no of numbers in first column
* returns 2d list of strings and dimensions of each sheet and name of sheets in workbook(excel file)
* next slide consists of code chunk which performs this operation

+++?code=azure.py&lang=python
@[37-47](loads parameters and file required to read)
@[48](finds dimensions of sheet)
@[21-33](finds dimensions of sheet)
@[49-57](returns data in sheet)

---

###sending async request to azure cloud service
* Trigger to sends all requests
* stores their memory locations
* waits until all responds


+++?code=azure.py&lang=python
@[179-191](loads required parameters)
@[192-195](transfer control for sending async request and location)
@[172-176](async function)
@[201-202](waits until response)
@[203-221](filter required data and handle exceptions)

---
## generating word cloud and pie chart
+++?code=azure.py&lang=python
@[142-149](word cloud generation)   
@[151-169](piechart generation)

---
### Remaining processing
* Same thing done with topic detection
  * but a little complicated(code)
* Extracted most similar keys in answers from a set of initally provided keys
* Same thing done with google API with some changes in format of input and output

---
## Future scope
* If integrated with Google or Office 365 online forums
  * Can directly analyse online discussion forums
* Can add a function for gathering most relevant reviews or answers for given keywords
* Pythom has largest support for natural language processing libraries (Spacy,NLTK etc)
