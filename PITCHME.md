### Text Analysing Application using
### Natural Language Processing(NLP)

---
## What is this application about ?
+++
* Surveys consists of large amount of text
* Time consuming to read all the text and come to a conclusion
* This application gives better intution over data in less time
* Uses azure and google NLP cloud services
---
## What this application can do ?
+++
### Generates Word Cloud from text

this is an image generated from answers about question
What is professional excellence ?


+++
### Generates Pie charts illustrating sentiment of data
![Sentiment Pie Chart](/images/piechart.png)

---
### What this application uses in azure services ?
* Uses azure *sentiment analysis*(piechart)
* Uses azure key word detection for *extracting keywords*(word cloud)
* Uses azure *topic detection* for generating topic of each sentence (word cloud)
  * keys generated avoids noise in image
* also uses WUP similarity for generating Word-Cloud related to keywords in questionâ€‹

+++
### But !!!
* topic detection *takes 7 to 8 minutes* for returning result
* Some part of request does not support asynchronous requests
* Extracting keywords related to question take 6 to 7 seconds of compilation

### What this application uses in google cloud services ?
* Uses google *sentiment analysis*
* Uses google *syntax analysis*
  * Returns every word saperately tagged with
    * parts of speech (tag,mood,tense etc.)
    * dependency edge of syntax tree
    * lemma of each word
* Google NLP service als have *entity analysis* which extracts *common nouns* from text

---
### Asynchronous nature of code
* (best ans most intresting part of application)
* First I sent http request to REST services **one by one**
  * as a result it **took 30 seconds** for each time compile and run
* Used libraries **asyncio,aiohttp** and some features of python3 *yield from*
* When i made it **asynchronous** it took **less than 3 seconds** for compile and run

+++
### Not only this !!!
* as the code is written in python
  * It have good scope for furthur development
  * Pythom has largest support for natural language processing libraries (Spacy,NLTK etc)
  * Very easy to use on integrating this application with google docs or microsoft online excel sheets

---
# Design of Application
---

###reading from file
* decides no of columns by considering no of headings
* decides no of rows by considering no of numbers in first column
* returns 2d list of strings and dimensions of each sheet and name of sheets in workbook(excel file)
* next slide consists of code chunk which performs this operation

+++?code=azure.py&lang=python
@[37-47](loads parameters and file required to read)
@[48](finds dimensions of sheet)
@[21-33](finds dimensions of sheet)
@[49-57](returns data in sheet)

---

###sending async request to azure cloud service
* Trigger to sends all requests
* stores their memory locations
* waits until all responds


+++?code=azure.py&lang=python
@[179-191](loads required parameters)
@[192-193](transfer control for sending async request and location)
@[172-176](async function)
@[199-200](waits until response)
@[201-219](filter required data and handle exceptions)

---
## generating word cloud and pie chart
+++?code=azure.py&lang=python
@[142-149](word cloud generation)   
@[151-169](piechart generation)

---
### Remaining processing
* Same thing done with topic detection
  * but a little complicated(code)
* Then extrcated related keywords in answers from given keys
* Same thing done with google API with some changes in format of input and output
